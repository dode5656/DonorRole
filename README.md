# RoleSync
 
Want to make your players verify their discord account with your server? You came to the right place!

RoleSync is a plugin that allows you to connect your discord server and minecraft server. Player can just run /sync command and get themselves role(s) in the discord server depending on their permissions.

This is my first plugin so bear with me.
